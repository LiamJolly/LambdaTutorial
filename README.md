# LambdaTutorial

Part of a LambdaTutorial that I will be writing. Contains 3 examples of filtering a set of user data.

Simple - Using for loops and if statements to filter user data.
Anonymous - Using anonymous classes to create reusable filters.
Lambda - Using Lambda expressions to filter the user data.

User data was generated using https://www.mockaroo.com.

Will update this readme with the link to the tutorial once it's written!
